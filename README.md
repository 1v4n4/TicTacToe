## How to play

Tic-tac-toe is a  game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. If all nine squares are full, and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
